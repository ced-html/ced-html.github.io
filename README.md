Chinese-English dictionary CEDICT (https://www.mdbg.net) in html

There is: rare search flexibility, the ability to voice content (select -> voice), create notes and others. Since this is a regular html file, no installation steps are required, just open it in your browser. Opening speed and search time directly depend on the speed of the hardware and browser version.

Tips for use:
- Double tap (click) on the input field text displays quick settings for selecting a scheme and search map;
- If you use a server to open, make sure that serviceworker.js is installed correctly and that you have a valid SSL certificate - this will provide an offline dictionary cache, which will save traffic and speed up loading, and will also allow you to use desktop shortcuts for quick access;
- Search schemes use regular expressions and JavaScript . Schemes can be divided into two groups - with and without an input point. You can use one of two input points - reg or txt . The reg insertion point does not escape regular expression special characters, the txt insertion point does. A search scheme without an insertion point works like a search query using the example of the preset " Combined characters " scheme.
